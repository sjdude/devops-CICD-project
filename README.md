# App Background
* This repository is the front-end component of a MERN-stack project created for the NUS SGUS Fintech program.
* This App simulates a primitive banking administrative portal.
* The project's MERN-stack utilizes the following:
  * React.js - front-end
  * Express.js & Node.js - back-end
  * mySQL - database
* The entire stack has been deployed online on Heroku. You can try it [here](https://devops-cicd-project.herokuapp.com/).

  Note: Apps hosted on Heroku go to sleep after a period of inactivity. Initial loading/queries may take awhile as the App re-awakens.
## To run this App locally, run the following commands from your command line:
